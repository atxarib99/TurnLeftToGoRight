# LiftLag

LiftLag is an Assetto Corsa application that alarms the driver when the front wing or diffuser is outside of optimal working conditions. This is currently set to anytime the coefficient of lift multiplier drops below 0.8. This app will aid you in optimizing vehicle ride heights and reduce time spent outside of optimal aero conditions.
