# Scrubometer

This app is similar to [Camber Extravaganza](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/camber-extravaganza.19703/) but for Slip Angles. 

Scrubometer will hunt through the games tyre data files, pull the optimal slip angle, and chart your current slip angles for each tyre! Reach for the optimal blue line! Happy praccy!

## Slip Angle Intro
Don't know what a slip angle is? Then quit! JK, Slip Angle is the difference in angle between where your tires are facing and the vector your vehicle is travelling. Understeer is HIGH slip angle in the front tyres. Oversteer is HIGH slip angle in the rear tyres. Driving in a straight line like a true racer is 0 slip angle! Use Scrubometer to check on the fly that you're not putting in too much steering angle, or sliding the car too much!
